## 🧭 About Me

I’m a developer who thrives on turning clean logic into real-world solutions. With hands-on experience building responsive interfaces and developing APIs, I work across the stack with a focus on code clarity, reusability, and purpose. I'm especially drawn to building user-friendly applications that scale well — both in code and impact.

Currently focused on mastering the MERN stack, I believe in building more than just apps — I aim for interfaces and systems that feel good to use.
